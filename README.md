This project is supposed to solve the popular word game known as spellathon. To give it the compulsory letter you give it the letter alone for example "c". To give it the optional lettters give them together as a string for example "nrkesi". Do not include the compulsory letter with the otional letter. If a letter shows up multiple times input it multiple times for example "nrrkes". In its current state the bot does not filter out plural words, foreign words or proper names.
